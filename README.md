# Tool.VampireSurvivorsSaveVerifier
A tool to successfully rebuild the checksum of the save file after user modification.

Please backup your save file before using this. 
To use, set the `saveLocation` and `steamUserId` and run the script.  

The script is written to take the save from `saveLocation` and place it in the folder that the game expects it.
